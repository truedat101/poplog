# Story files for the Pop-11 Z-machine

Z-code story files used to develop and test `lib zmachine`
(see `docs/projects/zmachine-design.md`).

**Only freely-licensed files live here.** Commercial Infocom story
files — Zork I, Mini-Zork, and the rest — are Activision property and
are *never* committed to this repository, however widely they circulate.
The runner takes a path, so use your own copy:

```sh
./poplog basepop11 examples/zplay.p ~/games/zork1.z3
```

## What's here

| File | What it is | Terms |
|------|------------|-------|
| `czech.inf` | Source of CZECH — the Comprehensive Z-machine Emulation CHecker, by Amir Karger, based on Evin Robertson's public-domain nitfol test script | The source states: *"See README.txt for license. (Basically, use/copy/modify, but be nice.)"* — freely distributable |
| `czech.z3` | `czech.inf` compiled for Z-machine **version 3**, by us (`tools/zmachine/build-testgames.sh`) | as above |
| `parsertest.inf` | A tiny v3 story written for this project: a known six-word dictionary, one `@sread`, and a report of what the interpreter put in the parse buffer | MIT, same as this repository |
| `parsertest.z3` | `parsertest.inf` compiled for v3 | as above |
| `czech.z5` | `czech.inf` compiled for **version 5** — the extended opcodes, eight-operand calls and v5 input model | as `czech.inf` |
| `cave.inf` | **THE POPLOG CAVE** — a miniature adventure written for this project: four locations, a lamp, a gem and a light puzzle, in library-free Inform 6. Something freely licensed to actually *play*, since every interactive fiction worth playing belongs to somebody | MIT, same as this repository |
| `cave.z3` | `cave.inf` compiled for v3 | as above |

## Rebuilding

`czech.z3` is a build artifact, committed so CI needs no toolchain:

```sh
brew install inform6          # provides the `inform` binary (Inform 6.44+)
tools/zmachine/build-testgames.sh
```

CZECH compiles for several Z-machine versions (`-v3`, `-v4`, `-v6`,
`-v8`); v3 is what the interpreter targets first. On v3 the suite is a
clean gate — **368 tests, 349 passed, 0 failed, 19 print tests** —
which is what `tools/tests/test_zmachine.p` asserts.

## Development-only story files (not committed)

These live outside the repo and are used locally for bring-up:

- **`minizork.z3`** — Mini-Zork I (Infocom, 1988, Release 34). A real
  v3 Infocom game and the ideal M3 target: 52 KB, the full "West of
  House" opening, mailbox, leaflet, trap door. **Activision property**;
  historically given away on a UK magazine cassette but never formally
  licensed. Local development only.
- **`advent.z5`** — Adventure (Crowther & Woods; Graham Nelson's Inform
  port, Release 9). Plays correctly here as of M4, and its walkthrough
  matches the reference interpreter exactly. **Not committed**: the
  original is public domain and the Inform port is widely redistributed,
  but the sibling project's own licence audit lists "capture the
  author's licence statement verbatim" as still outstanding, and that is
  a call for the repository owner rather than something to assume.
  Until then it stays a local target, reached by path.

Both, plus a reference TypeScript interpreter and walkthrough scripts,
are in the sibling project `IfWhenZMachineSpectacles` (see
`docs/projects/zmachine-design.md` §7 for how it is used as a
differential-testing oracle).
