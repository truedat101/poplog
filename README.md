*English | [日本語](README.ja.md)*

POPLOG is a free, open source, multi-language software development
environment providing incremental compilers for a number of interactive
programming languages, notably:

* Pop-11
    The core language of Poplog, including a rich interface to the X
    window system and a powerful Object Oriented programming extension,
    Objectclass, developed by Steve Leach now a standard part of the
    language (comparable to CLOS as an extension of LISP). 
* Prolog
    Standard prolog with the "Edinburgh" syntax.
* Common Lisp
    Compatible with most of CLTL2 (Common Lisp the language, 2nd
    Edition) by G.L. Steele
* Standard ML
    A powerful, strongly typed, polymorphic, functional language.

Poplog provides support for multi-paradigm software development in a
rapid prototyping environment, because of the use of (fast) incremental
compilers for all the languages.  There is substantial AI and teaching
material using Poplog, some included in this repository, some
in separate packages repository, some available on the net.

## The four languages, live

All four incremental compilers share one virtual machine and one saved image,
and interoperate freely.  Captured from the Apple Silicon (macOS) build:

| Pop-11 — the core language | Prolog — Edinburgh syntax |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Pop-11 REPL](docs/images/repl-pop11.png) | ![Prolog REPL](docs/images/repl-prolog.png) |
| **Common Lisp — CLTL2** | **Standard ML — type inference** |
| ![Common Lisp REPL](docs/images/repl-clisp.png) | ![Standard ML REPL](docs/images/repl-pml.png) |

## Forth — a fifth language (new in this fork)

The four languages above are classic Poplog.  This fork adds a fifth,
**Forth**, as a first-class Poplog subsystem.  The design leans on Poplog's
open-stack calling convention so the implementation stays small and the result
is genuinely native:

* **Forth's data stack *is* the Poplog user stack**, so Forth primitives are
  ordinary open-stack Pop-11 procedures (`+` is `define f_plus(x,y); x+y
  enddefine`).
* **Colon definitions compile to machine code.**  `: name … ;` transpiles to a
  Pop-11 procedure and is run through Poplog's incremental compiler, so a Forth
  word is a real native procedure — not threaded/interpreted code.  Control
  words (`if/else/then`, `begin/until`, `begin/while/repeat`, `do/loop`,
  `recurse`, `exit`) map onto Pop-11 constructs at compile time.
* **A first-class subsystem:** `.fth` is a recognised file type and `uses
  forth;` enters the REPL, alongside `pop11`/`lisp`/`prolog`/`ml`; `bye` or
  `pop11` returns to Pop-11.

```
$ tools/forth.sh                 # interactive REPL  (-t testbench, -b bench, -c '…')
forth> : sq  dup * ;
forth> 9 sq .
81  ok
forth> : fib  dup 2 < if drop 1 else dup 1 - recurse swap 2 - recurse + then ;
forth> 10 fib .
89  ok
```

The current core covers arithmetic, ~40 stack/compare/bitwise/IO words, native
colon definitions, the control words above, counted loops (`do/loop/i/j/leave`),
`variable`/`constant`/`@`/`!`, a return stack (`>r r@ r>`), and string literals.
It is newer and leaner than the four mature languages (no `+loop` /
`create does>` / `value` yet; case-sensitive).  Because it is pure Pop-11 it
runs on **every platform Poplog does**; the built-in `testbench` is **21/21** on
macOS arm64 and on RISC-V (StarFive VisionFive).  Implementation:
`pop/forth/src/forth.p`; examples in `pop/forth/examples/`; performance in
[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md#forth).

## Platforms

Poplog builds and runs natively on a growing set of platforms
(status as of June 2026):

| OS | Architecture | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Linux** | x86-64 | ✅ Supported | Reference platform |
| **Linux** | AArch64 (ARM64) | ✅ Supported | Validated + benchmarked on **Raspberry Pi 5** and **MediaTek Genio 720** (MT8391, 2×A78+6×A55; GlobalScale Cortadodeck 720) — all four languages + saved images.  Generic `armv8-a`, no core-specific tuning, so other ARM64 boards (Qualcomm Snapdragon etc.) should follow readily |
| **macOS** | Apple Silicon (arm64) | ✅ Supported | Native Mach-O port — self-hosting, all four languages, terminal VED, C↔Pop callbacks, and native graphics |
| **Linux** | ARM32 (`armv6`/`armv7`) | ✅ Supported | Long-standing 32-bit ARM port (`pop/src/syscomp/arm`); Raspberry Pi 1–3 and other 32-bit ARM Linux.  Not benchmarked in this report |
| **Solaris** | x86 (i386) | ✅ Supported | Upstream port (W. Hebisch); tested on Solaris 10 (`CC=gcc`, vendored `corepop_solaris.i386`).  Not benchmarked here |
| **FreeBSD** | x86-64 | ✅ Supported | Upstream port (W. Hebisch); tested on x86-64.  Not benchmarked here |
| **Linux** | RISC-V (`riscv64`, RV64GC) | ✅ Supported | Native RV64GC/LP64D port, self-hosting on a **StarFive VisionFive** (dual SiFive U74) — all four languages, saved images, terminal VED, and the FFI float ABI.  `tools/validate-riscv64.sh` = 14/14; also bootstrapped from the released seed corepop on a cloud RV64 host (Ubuntu 24.04), where the `lib json`/`lib crypto` suites pass.  See `PORTING-RISCV64-LINUX.md` |
| **Windows** | x86-64 | 🚧 TODO | Not yet ported (WSL2 runs the Linux build as an interim) |

"Supported" means it builds and runs.  The first three rows plus RISC-V are
validated *and* benchmarked in this fork; ARM32, Solaris/x86 and FreeBSD/x86-64
are existing Poplog ports (ARM32 long-standing; Solaris + FreeBSD recent upstream
additions by W. Hebisch) that simply haven't been re-tested or benchmarked here.
The one remaining 🚧 row (Windows) is genuinely not yet ported.  See the
[platform-coverage table in BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md#platform-coverage).

Per-platform porting notes: `PORTING-ARM64-LINUX-RPI5.md` and
`PORTING-ARM64-M-SILICON-OSX.md`.

## Install

Three ways in, fastest first:

**1. Binary one-liner (~2 MB download; also installs the
[pop11 Claude skill](.claude/skills/pop11/SKILL.md)):**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IoTone/poplog/master/tools/install-skill.sh | sh
```

Detects your platform, pulls `pop11-skill-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` from the
latest GitHub release (macOS arm64 and Linux x86-64 to start), unpacks a
relocatable runtime (`basepop11` + libraries) to `~/.local/share/pop11-skill`,
and finishes with a live smoke test.  `POP11_SKILL_PREFIX` overrides the
location; `POP11_SKILL_URL` pins a version (any curl-able URL, including
`file://`).  Uninstall:
`rm -rf ~/.local/share/pop11-skill ~/.claude/skills/pop11 ~/.cache/pop11-skill`.
Tarballs are built by `tools/release-skill-tarball.sh` and published with
checksums (`SHA256SUMS.pop11-skill`) on the releases page.

**2. From source** — see [INSTALL](INSTALL): seed `target/pop/corepop`
(binaries vendored under `nix/seeds/` for the four ported platforms),
then `./configure && make all`.

**3. Nix** — see the next section.

## Agents: the MCP server

Poplog ships an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server — written
in Pop-11 itself (`pop/mcp/pop11_mcp.p`) — so any MCP-capable agent gets
a **persistent, natively-compiled Pop-11 session** with four tools:
`pop11_eval` (state and compiled procedures survive between calls;
mishaps come back as diagnostics and the session survives),
`pop11_help` (the real HELP/REF/TEACH corpus), `pop11_checkpoint`
(freeze the whole session to a ~200 KB image, optionally gated on a
verify expression) and `pop11_state`.  Measured: 100+ eval round trips
in 0.04 s wall including engine startup.

Register it with Claude Code (the tarball install ships the launcher
too, at `~/.local/share/pop11-skill/tools/pop11-mcp`):

```sh
# every project on this machine:
claude mcp add --scope user pop11 -- /path/to/poplog/tools/pop11-mcp

# or one project (writes a committable .mcp.json):
claude mcp add --scope project pop11 -- /path/to/poplog/tools/pop11-mcp
```

This checkout's own [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) registers it for sessions
started here.  Resume a checkpointed session with
`pop11-mcp --restore image.psv`.  Scope semantics and the `.mcp.json`
format are documented in the
[Claude Code MCP docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp);
other MCP clients configure the same stdio command their own way.
End-to-end protocol tests: `python3 tools/mcp/test-e2e.py`.

## Editors: the LSP server

The same idea for editors: a Language Server Protocol server written in
Pop-11 (`pop/lsp/pop11_lsp.p`, launched by `tools/pop11-lsp`, also
shipped in the tarball). Because the server *is* a Poplog session,
diagnostics come from the **real compiler** — buffers are checked with
`pop_syntax_only` set, so the VM plants nothing and nothing in your file
executes — hover shows the actual HELP/REF/TEACH entry for the word
under the cursor, and completion draws from the live dictionary. The
[Neovim plugin](editors/nvim/) starts it automatically for `pop11`
buffers; any LSP client can run the same stdio command. End-to-end
protocol tests: `python3 tools/lsp/test-e2e.py`.

Both servers sit on one transport, `pop/lib/lib/jsonrpc.p` — line and
Content-Length framing, stdio and TCP endpoints, and a serve loop that
turns a handler mishap into a `-32603` and keeps going. Factoring it out
took 342 lines out of the two servers, and it is what the swank server
below is built on.

## Editors: the live session

`pop/lib/lib/swank.p` is the other half of the idea, named after SLIME's
swank for the same reason: the interesting thing an editor can talk to
is not a compiler but a **running session**. The LSP server answers
questions about text; this answers questions about a live heap — what a
name is bound to *now*, what a procedure printed *while it ran*, which
frames were on the stack when it died.

Output streams back as it is produced rather than arriving in one lump
at the end, mishaps come back as data (`message`, `culprits`, `frames`)
rather than as a block of text to scrape, and a runaway loop is stopped
by signalling the pid the handshake hands you — which works because
`I_CHECK` was implemented on arm64 and riscv64 earlier in this arc.

Start one from a session you are already using, and the editor gets that
session, with everything in it:

```pop11
uses swank;
swank_serve(4005);          ;;; SLIME's port, since it is the same idea
```

or `tools/pop11-swank` to start a fresh one. Tests:
`sh tools/test-libs.sh tools/tests/test_swank.p` — 56 checks against a
real server in a second process, including the interrupt.

The [Emacs package](editors/emacs/) is the client: `M-x pop11-swank`
starts a session and connects, and from then on the editing commands go
there. Output streams into the REPL as the code runs, a mishap opens a
backtrace buffer with real frames, `C-c C-i` inspects a value and drills
into its parts by handle, `M-.` asks the running heap where a name came
from, completion reads the live dictionary, and `C-c C-a` stops a
runaway loop.

`TEACH SWANK` is the walkthrough: connecting by hand, watching output
stream, taking a mishap apart, interrupting a runaway loop, inspecting a
live value -- before any editor is involved.

The [Emacs package](editors/emacs/) goes further and reaches for the
other half of the idea: `M-x run-pop11` puts a real Poplog listener in a
comint buffer, and the editing buffer gets VED's `ENTER` commands on
Emacs keys — `C-x C-e` for `ENTER l1`, `C-c C-r` for `ENTER lmr`,
`C-M-x` for `ENTER lcp` — so a procedure goes from buffer to running
image without leaving the file. Tests:
`emacs -Q --batch -l tools/emacs/test-e2e.el`.

## Packaging (Nix)

A self-contained **Nix flake** builds and bootstraps the whole system — all
four languages and their saved images — from source, with no manual seed or
toolchain setup.  Tested end-to-end on `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-darwin`;
the `aarch64-linux` build is deployed and benchmarked on a MediaTek Genio 720
(the **G720** column in BENCHMARKS.md is the flake build running from a Nix
profile).

```sh
nix build .#poplog          # build; then ./result/bin/{pop11,clisp,prolog,pml,ved}
nix run   .#pop11           # run a REPL directly (or .#prolog / .#clisp / .#pml)
nix shell .#poplog          # drop all five front-ends onto $PATH
nix develop                 # dev shell for hacking on Poplog sources
nix build .#poplog-gfx      # experimental graphics: Metal on macOS, SDL3+OpenGL3 on Linux
```

The flake exposes `packages`, `apps`, and a `devShell` for every supported
system.  On macOS the build is signed ad-hoc with **no entitlements required**.

**First-build cost:** Nix builds the whole toolchain closure from source, so
the first build pulls **~1.1 GB** of cached dependencies and lands a **~1.2 GiB**
on-disk closure (the Poplog out-path is ~95 MB; the rest is shared deps), taking
a couple of minutes to build.  Subsequent builds of the same source fetch
nothing.  Full details — use cases, costs, the bootstrap-seed story, and the
graphics variant — are in **[`nix/README.md`](nix/README.md)**.

## Native graphics (experimental)

Historically Poplog's graphics were tied to the X window system (Xpw / `xved`).
There is now an **optional native graphics backend** built on
[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), selected at build time with
`./configure --experimental-graphics` (it implies "no X"):

* **Metal + Cocoa** (macOS) — a native window with no X server or XQuartz.
* **SDL3 + OpenGL3** (macOS *or* Linux/Unix) — SDL3 selects the display
  transport at run time — **Wayland**, X11, or KMS/DRM — so there is **no hard
  X11 dependency**; it also renders **headless** via Mesa software (llvmpipe)
  for CI.

The **backend is chosen at build time**, so you can pick one and explore:

```sh
./configure --experimental-graphics          # per-OS default: Metal on macOS, SDL elsewhere
./configure --experimental-graphics=metal     # force Metal  (macOS only)
./configure --experimental-graphics=sdl       # force SDL3 + OpenGL (macOS or Linux)
```

`=sdl` needs SDL3 (`pkg-config sdl3` — e.g. `brew install sdl3`; or point at a
build with `SDL3_CFLAGS=… SDL3_LIBS=… ./configure --experimental-graphics=sdl`).
The running backend (and GPU) is reported by `gfx_spec()`; see the badge below.

The macOS **Metal** backend, live — `examples/cube3d.p`, a smooth vsync-paced
spin with an on-screen stats badge (backend, GPU, live FPS):

![Spinning 3D cube on the macOS Metal backend](docs/images/cube3d-metal.gif)

The classic `rc_graphic` turtle library and `rc_mouse` are ported onto it, so
existing Pop-11 graphics code runs unchanged.  Graphics are strictly **opt-in**:
the default build (and `nix build .#poplog`) is console-only.

| `rc_graphic` turtle on macOS (Metal) | Headless render on Linux (SDL3 + llvmpipe, no display) |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![macOS native graphics](docs/images/graphics-macos.png) | ![Linux headless graphics](docs/images/graphics-linux-headless.png) |

The right-hand image was rendered on Linux with **no display, GPU, or
compositor** (`tools/validate-gfx-headless.sh`) — the reproducible CI gate for
the graphics stack.

A few runnable demos live in [`examples/`](examples/) (`pop11
examples/tenprint.p` on a graphics build) — for instance the classic
[10 PRINT](https://10print.org/) maze and "POPLOG" drawn out of small letters:

| `examples/tenprint.p` | `examples/poplog_letters.p` |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![10 PRINT maze](docs/images/ex-tenprint.png) | ![POPLOG in letters](docs/images/ex-poplog-letters.png) |

## Performance

Poplog's incremental compilers emit fast native code on every backend.  For
cross-platform and cross-language benchmark numbers (x86-64, Apple M-series,
Raspberry Pi 5, MediaTek Genio 720, RISC-V, with Python and Perl baselines for
context), see **[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)**.

## Documentation

The full in-tree corpus — 900+ HELP, TEACH and REF files — is browsable
at **<https://iotone.github.io/poplog/>** (with
[`llms.txt`](https://iotone.github.io/poplog/llms.txt) for AI
assistants).  The site is regenerated on every push by
`tools/gen-docs.sh`, a Pop-11 program: Poplog builds its own docs site
in CI, from a released seed corepop, in under a second of generator
time.  Inside the system the same material is available as `help json`,
`teach json`, `ref regexp` etc. in ved.

## Learning material

Decades of open Pop-11/Prolog teaching material — the Birmingham AI course
TEACH files, the SimAgent toolkit, the Pop-11 Primer, and more — are one
command away:

```sh
tools/fetch-learning.sh --all       # fetch into learn/ (gitignored)
```

The material is downloaded from public archives, never vendored here; a
generated `learn/learn.p` wires it into `teach`/`help` inside Poplog.  See
**[LEARNING.md](LEARNING.md)** for the pack list and usage.

This is cleaned up version of Poplog sources, currently only
core part.  It misses binary needed for bootstrap and extensions
(packages).  Packages are in separate repository:

  https://github.com/hebisch/poplog_packages

Bootstrap (`corepop`) binaries for the platforms ported here — x86-64
Linux, AArch64 Linux, Apple Silicon macOS, and RISC-V RV64GC Linux — are
published with checksums on this repository's releases page:

  https://github.com/IoTone/poplog/releases

(e.g. `releases/latest/download/corepop-aarch64-linux`; the same seeds
are vendored under `nix/seeds/` for the Nix flake build).  For the older
upstream platforms you can find bootstrap binaries at:

  https://poplog.fricas.org/corepops

There is buildable tarball for Intel/AMD 64-bit Linux at

  http://fricas.org/~hebisch/poplog

(this build version does not include newest changes to repository).

The **AArch64 Linux** port (see the Platforms table above) is written to the
generic `armv8-a` baseline and flushes the instruction cache via
`__clear_cache`, so it ports readily to other ARM64 boards -- the main
platform-specific knob is the kernel **page size** (saved images are
page-aligned; the Pi 5 uses 16 KB pages).  See `PORTING-ARM64-LINUX-RPI5.md`
(and its "Portability to other AArch64 platforms" section) for details.

For more detailed installation instructions see INSTALL.
