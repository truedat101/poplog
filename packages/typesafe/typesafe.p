/* --- TypeSafe Evaluation API client for Pop-11 -------------------------
 > File:            packages/typesafe/typesafe.p
 > Purpose:         Talk to https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone from Pop-11
 > Documentation:   packages/typesafe/README.md
 >
 > NOT part of the Poplog release.  This is an out-of-tree library: it sits
 > on http_client, json and crypto, all of which ARE shipped, and installs
 > into $poplocal/local/auto where POPLOCALAUTO puts it first on
 > popautolist.  Nothing in pop/ knows it exists.
 >
 > The API is one endpoint.  You hand it some state and a map of typed
 > questions; it hands back a typed answer per question plus token usage.
 > Three question types:
 >
 >   noul    yes/no, with criteria for each side, answered as a probability
 >   choice  named options, answered with the pick plus probabilities
 >   score   an ordered rubric, answered with a position on it

;;;   * the model: we ASK for jev-latest and the server RESOLVES it, so the
;;;     answer says jev-1.13.0.  That is the one you need to reproduce a
;;;     result, and it arrives free in every response -- worth keeping
;;;     rather than discarding
;;;   * this client's own version, which tracks nothing upstream: it is an
;;;     independent client, not a port of anyone's SDK
