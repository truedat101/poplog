 > Infocom had to fit a novel into 128K, so text is packed three 5-bit
 > "z-characters" to a 16-bit word, with the top bit marking the last word
 > of a string.  Those 5 bits address one of three 26-letter alphabets,
 > with a handful of values reserved for shifting between them, for
 > abbreviations (a built-in dictionary of common phrases), and for an
 > escape that spells out an arbitrary character in ten bits.
 >
 > Decoding is therefore a small state machine over a stream of z-chars,
 > which is what this file is.  Two entry points:
 >
 >     zm_text_out(addr, emit) -> next_addr     stream to a procedure
 >     zm_text(addr) -> string                  collect into a string
 >
 > The streaming form is the primitive because the interpreter wants to
 > send characters straight to the screen, not build strings it throws away.

;;; A2's first slot is the ten-bit escape and never reaches a lookup; its
;;; second is newline.  (v1 ordered A2 differently; we do v3 and up.)

;;; newline, which in ZSCII is code 13 -- not Pop-11's 10.  The table is
