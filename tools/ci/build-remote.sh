# build-remote.sh — run the CI build for one platform on a remote machine
# over plain ssh, driven from the Linux builder.  No Jenkins agent, no JVM
# and no swarm client is needed on the target board: if you can ssh to it
# and it has cc/make/curl/tar, it can be a CI platform.
#
#   tools/ci/build-remote.sh <ssh-host> [outdir] [remote-dir]
#
# <ssh-host> is anything ssh accepts — an ~/.ssh/config alias ("raspi5"),
# or user@host.  In Jenkins it comes from a job parameter or credential,
# never from this repo (see the Jenkinsfile header).  It may carry the
# remote dir as a "host:dir" suffix, so a single parameter can aim a
# short-on-disk board at an existing tree: "riscv-cloud:poplog".
# [outdir]     local directory to collect the tarball into (default: dist)
# [remote-dir] build tree on the remote, relative to its $HOME
#              (default: poplog-ci).  Pointing this at a tree that already
#              has target/pop/basepop11 reuses the engine (much faster, and
#              it matters on boards with little free disk).
#
# Steps:
#   1. probe   — check ssh works and the remote has the build prerequisites
#   2. sync    — copy this working tree's *tracked* files (git ls-files,
#                so local edits go too) through tar over the ssh channel.
#                Tracked-only matters: stamp_*, Makefile, ./poplog and
#                target/ are gitignored build products, and shipping this
#                machine's copies makes the remote make(1) skip its
#                directory-setup rules and fail.
#   3. build   — tools/ci/build-and-verify.sh on the remote, which fetches
#                that platform's corepop seed, builds, packages the skill
#                tarball and runs the installer smoke test.
#   4. collect — bring the tarball back to <outdir> so the caller can
#                archive/publish it exactly like a local build.
#
# Env: FORCE_ENGINE_REBUILD=1   rebuild the remote engine even if present
#      POP11_SEED_BASE_URL      corepop seed source (passed through)
#      SSH_OPTS                 extra ssh options, in -o form so scp takes
#                               them too (e.g. '-o BatchMode=yes').  On a
#                               board with a shaky link, '-o
#                               ServerAliveInterval=15' is worth adding: a
#                               build holds one channel open for many
#                               minutes.
#
# Exit: 0 built and collected      2 remote is unusable (missing tool/header,
#       3 the ssh link failed        unsupported platform, sync/copy trouble)
#       other  the remote build's own status, passed through
