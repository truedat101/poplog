"""teach2nb -- convert a Poplog TEACH file into a runnable Jupyter notebook.

TEACH files have a wonderfully mechanical layout: prose is flush-left,
code the reader should try is indented four spaces, and sections are
ruled with `-- Section name ----`.  That maps straight onto notebook
structure: prose becomes markdown, each indented block becomes a code
cell, section rules become headings.

    tools/jupyter/teach2nb.py pop/teach/lists [outdir]

With --execute, the notebook is run through the pop11 kernel
(allow_errors: TEACH files sometimes show mishaps on purpose, and the
session survives them), so the committed outputs are genuine.
